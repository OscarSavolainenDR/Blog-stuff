# Blog-stuff
Code from various blogs I've written, both from years ago. Super secret but actually not.


### VR Hypothesis
I read Nick Bostrom's Simulation Hypothesis and got super excited, and wondered if we could put numbers to it. I went pretty deep on it, but in my defence it was the start of the COVID lockdowns and I had 0 life.

### Memetic Theory
I was doing my PhD in Brain-Machine Interfaces, and similarly got interested by the idea of telepathy. I had this idea it would be a bad thing, since it would make ideas spread quicker, and that isn't necessarilly a good thing. I thought about it a lot and wrote a blog. Again, my only defence is that it was COVID lockdowns, and I had ***way*** too much time on my hands.
