%% VR Hypothesis script


% Last edit: 04/07/2020; Oscar Savolainen.

% Sctipt for calculating a preliminary lower bound on our probability of being in a VR.
% It is based on the blog post @ https://oscarsavolainen.wordpress.com/2020/07/07/the-virtual-reality-hypothesis/
% Code is available online @ https://github.com/OscarSavolainen/VR-Hypothesis.

% To do:
% - Add safety check to make sure all inputted parameters are within allowed specs, e.g. value_at_which_survival_stabilises within 0 and 1,
%   t_exp_BL > WL, spend_VR_percentage within 0 and 1, etc.
% - Simplify calculations to enable larger values of humanity_integral_limit (a.k.a. y)
