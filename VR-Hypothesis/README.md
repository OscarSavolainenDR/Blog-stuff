# VR-Hypothesis
Basic summary: some code with my best attempt to calculate how likely we are to be in a Virtual Reality, just for fun.


This is the code from my blog post on the Virtual Reality Hypothesis: https://oscarsavolainen.wordpress.com/2020/07/07/the-virtual-reality-hypothesis/

A detailed explanation of each of the functions can be found there.
I share it in case others want to experiment with different input parameters and sub-functions, to try get a more accurate estimate of our/your likelihood of being in a VR.
There is probably a lot of improvement to be made to the predictive functions, and I think I will be messing with this project for a long time to come.

The code is MATLAB-based, but it is quite simple. I plan to port it to Python combined with the blogpost as a Jupyter notebook at some point in the future. That being said, there's always another project :'(
