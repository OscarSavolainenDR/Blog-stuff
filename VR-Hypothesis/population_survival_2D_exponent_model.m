     % Function that produces a 2D map of decaying exponentials that are used to model humanity's chance of avoiding extinction.
     % Each decay exponential is weighted using a log-normal distribution. They are then summed together to give the average weighted
     % scenario. The final scenario is then weighted with a theta offset.
